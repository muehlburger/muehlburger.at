      <description>Currently I work on an implementation for authentication and authorization using Spring Boot, Spring Security, OAuth 2.0and JSON Web Tokens(JWT). In order to get a good understanding on these topics I found several talks that I’m going to list here.
“100% Stateless with JWT (JSON Web Token)” by Hubert Sablonnière. I found it very useful to get a better understanding on using JWTs to create a really stateless authentication architecture.</description>

      <description>In public keyinfrastructuresa common problem is that both communication partners have to have the same key in order communicate in a secure way (to encryptand decrypt messages properly). The question is how is it practically possible to share a secret keyover an untrusted channel like the internet for example. The solution is the use of asynchronous methods (public and private keys) in order to exchange the secret key in a secure way.</description>

      <description>Mashablehas just published a post titled “Nobody Can Stop Facebook Because Nobody Understands Facebook“. There is an interesting sentence in this post:
 Have the nuances of online privacybecome so complex that they’re beyond the comprehension of mere mortals? I’m not saying that Facebookhas any intent to cause confusion, but the complexities of the open vs closed debateand the prescriptive vs descriptive nature of the “everybody” settingeffectively act to shut down public discourse.</description>

      <description>On a six-minute interview on stage with TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg states that if he’d start facebook again all privacy settings by DEFAULT would be PUBLIC. A very interesting approach which leads to the question if people want if all of their data is available publicly? I personally do not.
Here is the interview of Zuckerberg:
