      <description>In this post I will explain how I set up the Android SDKon Ubuntu for my HTC Desire.
I first followed the steps for Ubuntu as described in Setting up a Device for Development:

      <description>Yesterday I received my new HPMini 5101 running Suse Linux Enterprise Desktop11 (SLED 11). Due to the fact, that i do not like working with Suse I installed Ubuntu 9.04but there were some problems regarding the wireless chipset (Broadcom5343) and the Ethernetadapter (Marvel 436c).
After installation the wireless and the ethernet devices were not working. The problem was that I needed to install proprietary drivers which were not included in Ubuntu due to licence issues.</description>
