      <description>Dilbert’s Salary Theorem states that: “Engineers and scientists will never make as much money as business executives.“
Now we have an mathematical proof that explains why this is true:
 Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power Postulate 2: Time is Money  As every engineer knows,
 Power = Work/Time

 Knowledge = Work/Time.

 Knowledge = Work/Money.</description>
