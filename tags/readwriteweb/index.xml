      <description>Recently I found a video on the web demonstrating a simple system sending push notifications to your iPhone whenever the mailman has delivered your post.
As a part of their “Internet of Things” series ReadWriteWebcame up with an article describing how Make Magazine built the system using an Arduino. This is a nice way of using this technology. In the following you can see the video demonstrating the system.

I am looking forward to updating my HTC Desirewhen it receives the update.
Update: Apart from this information ReadWriteWebfound some interesting new features as stated on their weblog:

ReadWriteWebwrites:
 Technically, what Wilson did was come up with an interface combining an Electroencephalogram, or brain wavemonitor, with an on screen keyboardfor selecting letters. The system lights up each key on the keyboard but is able to notice a difference in brain activity when the desired letter for input is lit.</description>

      <description>It stands to reason that people who are “starting to come down with something” often take the opportunity to search for information on what ails them, even before they discuss their symptoms with a healthcare professional. Who gets more of those searches than anyone? Google, of course. [ReadWriteWeb]
 Google offers a new service called Google Flu Trends. The service uses an analysis of Google’s millions of search queries every day to calculate flu trends.</description>
