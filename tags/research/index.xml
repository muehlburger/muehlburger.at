How many papers should you read in order to understand a field broadly? There is a good talk on this topic from Andrew Ng, an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University.

      <description>SEAmail is a prototype e-mail system implemented by Stanford University Logic Grouplead by Michael Genesereth, an associate professorof computer scienceat Stanford University. The interesting and innovative part of this e-mail system is the use of semantic technologies in order to determine the recipient of an e-mail message. Users don’t have to bother on keeping track of e-mail addresses, they just type in the real name of the recipient letting the system searching the right recipient address.</description>
