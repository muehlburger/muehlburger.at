      <description>In times of PRISMI decided to delete my Facebook account, a second time. My main reasons are the following:
I want to be in control of my data  I want to be in control of the data that I share. I am concerned about my privacy and therefore I do want to be in control of my data (or at least in as much control as possible) I do not want to have anybody else making aggregations and connections concerning my profiles apart the ones that I explicitly create.</description>
