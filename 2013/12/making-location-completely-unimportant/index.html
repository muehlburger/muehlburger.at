<blockquote>
<p>Technology is thus enabling arbitrary numbers of people from around the world to assemble in remote locations, without interrupting their ability to work or communicate with existing networks. In this sense, the future of technology is not really location-based apps; it is about making location completely unimportant. (via <a title="Software Is Reorganizing the World" href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/" target="_blank">Software Is Reorganizing the World by Balaji Srinivasan</a> and <a title="ma.tt" href="http://ma.tt/2013/12/reorganizing-the-world/" target="_blank">ma.tt</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like this notion of how technology creates new ways of working together finding solutions to real problems. I work remotely almost 100 percent of my time as a developer supporting our customers onsite. What about you? Do you work remotely as well?</p>
