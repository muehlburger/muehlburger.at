<p>Here are some of the most interesting videos from the post as well as some additional ones i have found:</p>
<h2 id="head-up-displays-for-consumer-vehicles">Head Up Displays for Consumer Vehicles</h2>
<p>The following video is showing an Apple iPhone App using the concept of Heas Up Displays. Working not so bad actually.</p>
<p>Originally Head Up Displays were developed for military use:</p>
<h2 id="gesture-based-interfaces">Gesture Based Interfaces</h2>
<p>Applications like the following are geture based and increasingly becoming populous.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCJ5dyNDfkE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCJ5dyNDfkE</a></p>
<p>Another very interesting type of gesture based interfaces are multitouch screens like seen in the following video:</p>
<h2 id="spatial-motion-interfaces">Spatial Motion Interfaces</h2>
<p>In Spatial Motion Interfaces the user becomes the controller and can controll the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application<!-- raw HTML omitted --> through movements the user is performing. Check out the following video for a demonstration. Lookes really interesting.</p>
<h2 id="a-classzem_slink-titleaugmented-reality-relwikipedia-hrefhttpenwikipediaorgwikiaugmented_realityaugmented-realitya"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Augmented Reality<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>Augmented Reality is brings <!-- raw HTML omitted -->virtual reality<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the real work together and makes it possible to build great applications. As <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mobile devices<!-- raw HTML omitted --> increase in computing power this applications are becoming more and more popular:</p>

<h2 id="other-sensor-based-interfaces">Other sensor Based Interfaces</h2>
<p>Other sensor Based Interfaces are Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) enabling to communicate with an application through just thinking of specific commands:</p>

<h4 id="mind-control-device-demonstration-8211-tan-le">Mind Control Device Demonstration â€“ Tan Le</h4>
<h2 id="smart-surfaces">Smart Surfaces</h2>
<p>Smart Surfaces are becoming more and more popular too. Here is a video showing this concept:</p>
<p>Feel free to add some interesting videos which you have found on the web. I am happy if you post them in the comments.</p>
