<p>In Alexander Osterwalder&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.muehlburger.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/business_model_canvas_poster.pdf">business model generation canvas</a> every organization&#8217;s business model can be described using 9 building blocks:</p>

<h2 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h2>

<p>This are all the people and organizations for which you are creating value. This includes simple users and paying customers.</p>

<h2 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h2>

<p>This are products and services that create value for each of your customer segments.</p>

<h2 id="channels">Channels</h2>

<p>Channels describe through which touch points you are interacting with your customers and delivering value.</p>

<h2 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h2>

<p>Customer Relationships outline the type of relationship you establish with your customers.</p>

<h2 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h2>

<p>The Revenue Streams make clear how and through which pricing mechanisms your business model is capturing value.</p>

<h2 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h2>

<p>Key Resources describe the infrastructure through which you create, deliver, and capture value. The Key Resources show which assets are in dispense of your business model.</p>

<h2 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h2>

<p>Key Activities show which things you really need to perform well in order to succeed with your business model.</p>

<h2 id="key-partnerships">Key Partnerships</h2>

<p>Key Partnerships describe which partners could leverage your business model, since you won&#8217;t own all of your Key Resources and you won&#8217;t perform all of your Key Activities by yourself.</p>

<h2 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h2>

<p>Having knowledge of your business model infrastructure helps you in describing your Cost Structure.</p>

<p>On YouTube you find the following video titled: &#8221; Alexander Osterwalder: The Business Model Canvas&#8221; which shows you the building blocks:</p>
