      <description>Machine Learning Class Machine Learning has always been a topic that attracted my interest. Currently I attend the “Machine Learning” class (@ml_class) offered by Prof. Andrew Ngfrom Stanford University. The class is awesome. The video lectures are made of small chunks explaining every topic in detail. A lot of topics were already covered:
 Linear regressionwith one variable Linear regression with multiple variable One-vs-all Classification Regularization Backpropagation Algorithm Neural Networks Practical advise for applying learning algorithms How to develop and debug learning algorithms Feature and model design, setting up experiments  Other interesting topics are following.</description>
