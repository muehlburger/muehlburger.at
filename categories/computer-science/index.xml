      <description>Grabeeter (@grabeeter) has just been launched and I think it is a very useful tool.&#xA;Grabeeter enables you to grab your tweets which means that you are able to store your tweets on your local harddrive in a structured format (xml at the time). Using the Grabeeter Client you are also able to perform searches on your local stored tweets.&#xA;This solves in parts the following problem. Maybe some of you have already noticed that if you have written more than 3200 Tweets you are not able to access your first tweets anymore due to Twitter access restrictions.</description>

      <description>Mashable has just published a post titled “Nobody Can Stop Facebook Because Nobody Understands Facebook“. There is an interesting sentence in this post:&#xA;Have the nuances of online privacy become so complex that they’re beyond the comprehension of mere mortals? I’m not saying that Facebook has any intent to cause confusion, but the complexities of the open vs closed debate and the prescriptive vs descriptive nature of the “everybody” setting effectively act to shut down public discourse.</description>

      <description>The Virtual Revolution refers to the fact that 20-25% of the word’s population is using the web by now, while other 80% are yet either not connected to broadband connections or are just not using it, as Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, states. In Afrika for example, people are now getting connected to broadband internet in a wide variety of areas. This means that the digital revolution that has shaped our world as we know it now, will happen in these areas too.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I received my new HP Mini 5101 running Suse Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 (SLED 11). Due to the fact, that i do not like working with Suse I installed Ubuntu 9.04 but there were some problems regarding the wireless chipset (Broadcom 5343) and the Ethernet adapter (Marvel 436c).&#xA;After installation the wireless and the ethernet devices were not working. The problem was that I needed to install proprietary drivers which were not included in Ubuntu due to licence issues.</description>

      <description>In order to describe what this article is about I cite Fridolin Wild, Felix Mödritscher and Stein E. Sigurdarson:&#xA;In this article we first clarify key concepts and assumptions for personalised learning environments. Afterwards, we summarise our critique on the contemporary models for personalised adaptive learning. Subsequently, we propose our alternative, i.e. the concept of a mash-up personal learning environment that provides adaptation mechanisms for learning environment construction and maintenance. The web application mash-up solution allows learners to reuse existing (web-based) tools plus services.</description>

On the website www.needaproblem.com you can pay and they are going to give you a problem to solve.</description>

      <description>CNN yesterday used holograms for interviews in their broadcast on the presedential election 2008. The journalist Jessica Yellin was beamed from Chicago to the CNN studio, New York where Wolf Blitzer was speaking with her virtual hologram. Very interesting technique which shows where new media is moving.&#xA;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2bRNA2wpYk&#xA;(via webstandard.at)</description>

      <description>Wer hat nicht schon verschiedenste IM Messenger auf seinem Computer installiert? Bei jedem Verbindungsaufbau zum Internet versuchen diese auch einen Teil des Internets für sich zu beanspruchen. Wem das zu stressig ist, bzw. wer möchte, dass all diese IM Dienste irgendwo zentral verwaltet werden können, der sollte sich einmal meebo genauer anschauen. Bei meebo ist es möglich jegliche IM Dienste über eine Website zu verwalten und über diese mittels seiner IM Accounts zu kommunizieren.</description>

      <description>Wie so viele Medien, die heutzutage up-to-date sein wollen beschäftigt sich auch die WELT ONLINE mit dem Thema Second Life. Auf der einen Seite gibt es Menschen, die sich das Second Life als neue Welt erschließen, vom großen Geld träumen und in der virtuellen Welt mit anderen “Avataren” ihren Feierabend verbringen.&#xA;Andere sehen das Second Life als ein Phänomen, das die Vereinsamung der Menschen vorantreibt, und durchaus Suchtpotenzial hat. Die Welt Online legt in diesem Artikel eine sehr interessante dritte Betrachtungsweise dar, die durchaus realitätsnah ist.</description>

      <description>Die neue Informationsgesellschaft, wie sie sich in Zeiten von Web2.0 zeigt, ist eines der spannenden Themen mit dem man sich zur Zeit auseinandersetzen kann.&#xA;Wo YouTube, Flickr, last.fm, Wikipedia, StudiVZ, SchuelerVZ, Facebook, … Benutzern die Möglichkeit selbst aktiv das neue Web in einer noch nie dagewesenen Weise zu gestalten, lässt sich erkennen wie groß der Bedarf ist, sich mit anderen Benutzern zu vernetzen. Nicht nur, dass Netzwerke, wie sie sich im StudiVZ bzw.</description>

      <description>Second Life wer kenn das nicht, oder besser gefragt, wer hat nicht schon davon gehört? Interessanterweise haben bei der letzten Vorlesung in einem Hörsaal von ca. 300 – 400 Studierenden nur 3 – 4 Studierende angegeben, Second Life zu spielen. Spielen? Second Life spielt man nicht, man lebt in der virtuellen Welt und versucht sich dort in irgendeiner Weise zu verwirklichen. Ob das gelingt ist verschieden. Interessant ist auch, dass die Studierenden von denen hier dei Rede ist nicht einem Studium nachgehen, welches überhaupt nichts mit Informationstechnologie zu tun hat.</description>
