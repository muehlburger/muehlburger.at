      <description>I have just added a new site to my this weblog called “Web Science Reading List“. This reading list collects a lot of interesting information on web science and similar topics. Since I do not have time to read all of the articles immediately I am going to collect them on this site and bookmark them on delicious too. If you are interested in this topic as well do not hesitate to contact me or to subscribe to my delicious bookmarks and to the feedof this weblog.</description>

      <description>Here is a great video explaining how Facebookuses Hadoopand Hiveto build Data Warehouses and analyse their huge ammount of data. Every day Facebook gets around 4TB+ of compressed data, which is amazing and also difficult to be analysed.

      <description>Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google was answering this question in an interesting interview at Gartner Symposium/ITxpo Orlando 2009. ReadWriteWebhas summarized the highlightsof Eric’s interview as follows:
  Five years from now the internet will be dominated by Chinese-languagecontent. Today’s teenagers are the model of how the web will work in five years – they jump from app to app to app seamlessly. Five years is a factor of ten in Moore’s Law, meaning that computers will be capable of far more by that time than they are today.</description>

 LONG BEACH, California — Students at the MIT Media Labhave developed a wearable computing system that turns any surface into an interactive display screen. The wearer can summon virtual gadgets and internet data at will, then dispel them like smoke when they’re done.

      <description>US President Obama enforces the use of Semantic Web Technologies. David Peterson posted on SitePointthe follwing:
 In a revolutionary move, Obama’s administration is set to utilise next generation web technologies to bring an unprecedented level of transparency to government. In this case it will shed light on how the roughly US $800 billion dollar economic stimulus will be spent. The recently launched recovery.gov website (powered by nothing other then Drupal) brought with it the promise that citizens would be able to view where the money was going and how it was going to be spent.</description>

      <description>SEAmail is a prototype e-mail system implemented by Stanford University Logic Grouplead by Michael Genesereth, an associate professorof computer scienceat Stanford University. The interesting and innovative part of this e-mail system is the use of semantic technologies in order to determine the recipient of an e-mail message. Users don’t have to bother on keeping track of e-mail addresses, they just type in the real name of the recipient letting the system searching the right recipient address.</description>

      <guid>/2009/01/how-googles-pagerank-predicts-nobel-prize-winners/</guid>
      <description>Sergej Maslow and Sidney Redner, both researchers have found out that Google‘s Page Rank algorithm could be used to predict future nobel price winners based on interlinked scientific papers. Scientific papers are interlinked by references, just like websites are which means they can be ranked by googles page rank algorithm. Taking into account how important a paper is, it is possible to generate a list of wighted ranked scientific papers.</description>

      <guid>/2008/11/smob-a-prototype-for-semantic-microblogging/</guid>
      <description>SMOBis a prototype developed to enable semantic microblogging. It can be seen as Twitter enriched with semantic data.
[slideshare id=472659&amp;amp;doc=sfsw-1213739228503754-8&amp;amp;w=425]
John Breslin writes in his blog post:
 The prototype uses FOAFand SIOCto model microbloggers, their properties, account and service information, and the microblog updates that users create. A multitude of publishing services can ping one or a set of aggregating servers as selected by each user, and it is important to note that users retain control of their own data through self hosting.</description>
