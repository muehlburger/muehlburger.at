How many papers should you read in order to understand a field broadly? There is a good talk on this topic from Andrew Ng, an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University.
  Here are my notes on how to read research papers:  Read 5-20 papers to get a basic understanding of a field Read 50 - 100 papers and you have a very good understanding  Steps to understand a field Andrew Ng proposes the following three steps to understand a field better:</description>

      <description>ImageMagick is a powerfull tool to manipulate images. If you want to convert a .PDF to an .PNG file use the following command:
convert -verbose -density 300 -trim input.pdf -quality 100 -sharpen 0x1.0 -background white -flatten output.png
Assuming that your pdf is called “input.pdf” and consists only of one page. The above command colors any transparent background white.

      <guid>/2015/04/how-to-choose-a-versioning-scheme-for-your-software/</guid>
      <description>As a developer, there comes the time were you think about how to version your software. One approach is “Semantic Versioning” which leverages the level of change on your public API. Depending on what you changed in your code, Semantic Versioning proposes different version numbers:
 Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
 MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</description>

Das folgende Video beschreibt was “die meisten Schulen (noch) nicht lehren” nämlich Software zu entwickeln und Quellcode lesen zu können.</description>

      <description>Dilbert’s Salary Theorem states that: “Engineers and scientists will never make as much money as business executives.“
Now we have an mathematical proof that explains why this is true:
 Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power Postulate 2: Time is Money  As every engineer knows,
 Power = Work/Time
 Since Knowledge = Power we have:
 Knowledge = Work/Time.
 Since Time = Money we have:
 Knowledge = Work/Money.</description>

One of the reasons why people are motivated doing what they do is because they see a purpose in their work. This fact you already see in “Maslov’s Hierarchy of Needs“.

      <description>Grabeeter(@grabeeter) has just been launched and I think it is a very useful tool.
Grabeeter enables you to grab your tweets which means that you are able to store your tweets on your local harddrive in a structured format (xml at the time). Using the Grabeeter Client you are also able to perform searches on your local stored tweets.
This solves in parts the following problem. Maybe some of you have already noticed that if you have written more than 3200 Tweets you are not able to access your first tweets anymore due to Twitter access restrictions.</description>

      <description>A very short answer is the following:
 “IBM is working to build a computing system that can understand and answer complex questions with enough precision and speed to compete against some of the best Jeopardy! contestants out there.” [IBM]
 A longer answer to this question is the following video explaining what I.B.M. Watson is in detail:

      <description>In public keyinfrastructuresa common problem is that both communication partners have to have the same key in order communicate in a secure way (to encryptand decrypt messages properly). The question is how is it practically possible to share a secret keyover an untrusted channel like the internet for example. The solution is the use of asynchronous methods (public and private keys) in order to exchange the secret key in a secure way.</description>

 Have the nuances of online privacybecome so complex that they’re beyond the comprehension of mere mortals?

      <guid>/2010/01/the-virtual-revolution-covered-by-the-bbc/</guid>
      <description>The Virtual Revolution refers to the fact that 20-25% of the word’s populationis using the web by now, while other 80% are yet either not connected to broadband connections or are just not using it, as Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, states. In Afrika for example, people are now getting connected to broadband internetin a wide variety of areas. This means that the digital revolutionthat has shaped our world as we know it now, will happen in these areas too.</description>

      <description>On a six-minute interview on stage with TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg states that if he’d start facebook again all privacy settings by DEFAULT would be PUBLIC. A very interesting approach which leads to the question if people want if all of their data is available publicly? I personally do not.
Here is the interview of Zuckerberg:

      <description>This time I discovered a great application developed by Microsoft Live Labscalled Pivot. Pivot enables users to discover huge information spaces by different visual filtering options. You are able to look at hundred thousands of information space entities such as pictures, … and filter these in different ways (zoom in/out, create links between different information items, …). The following video describes Pivot in more detail:

      <description>David Leggetttried to answer this question in a blogpostwritten for uxBOOTH. He writes:
 The future of how we interact with computers is exciting to say the least. What once seemed like nonsense outside of Hollywood and Science Fictionis now starting to find it’s way into reality, and some of the technology is a bit overwhelming. Have a taste of what the future of interface designhas to offer:

      <description>Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google was answering this question in an interesting interview at Gartner Symposium/ITxpo Orlando 2009. ReadWriteWebhas summarized the highlightsof Eric’s interview as follows:
  Five years from now the internet will be dominated by Chinese-languagecontent. Today’s teenagers are the model of how the web will work in five years – they jump from app to app to app seamlessly. Five years is a factor of ten in Moore’s Law, meaning that computers will be capable of far more by that time than they are today.</description>

Due to the fact, that i do not like working with Suse I installed Ubuntu 9.04but there were some problems regarding the wireless chipset (Broadcom5343) and the Ethernetadapter (Marvel 436c).
After installation the wireless and the ethernet devices were not working. The problem was that I needed to install proprietary drivers which were not included in Ubuntu due to licence issues.</description>

 In this article we first clarify key concepts and assumptions for personalised learningenvironments. Afterwards, we summarise our critique on the contemporary models for personalised adaptive learning. Subsequently, we propose our alternative, i.e. the concept of a mash-up personal learning environment that provides adaptation mechanisms for learning environment construction and maintenance. The web applicationmash-up solution allows learners to reuse existing (web-based) tools plus services.</description>

      <description>SMOBis a prototype developed to enable semantic microblogging. It can be seen as Twitter enriched with semantic data.
[slideshare id=472659&amp;amp;doc=sfsw-1213739228503754-8&amp;amp;w=425]
John Breslin writes in his blog post:
 The prototype uses FOAFand SIOCto model microbloggers, their properties, account and service information, and the microblog updates that users create. A multitude of publishing services can ping one or a set of aggregating servers as selected by each user, and it is important to note that users retain control of their own data through self hosting.</description>

      <description>It stands to reason that people who are “starting to come down with something” often take the opportunity to search for information on what ails them, even before they discuss their symptoms with a healthcare professional. Who gets more of those searches than anyone? Google, of course. [ReadWriteWeb]
 Google offers a new service called Google Flu Trends. The service uses an analysis of Google’s millions of search queries every day to calculate flu trends.</description>

      <description>CNNyesterday used holograms for interviews in their broadcast on the presedential election 2008. The journalist Jessica Yellin was beamed from Chicago to the CNN studio, New York where Wolf Blitzer was speaking with her virtual hologram. Very interesting technique which shows where new media is moving.

Ist Second Life ein Hype oder nicht!? Mich würde einmal interessieren, wer von Euch überhaupt Second Life spielt! Spielt ihr Second Life nur wegen GADI oder habt ihr auch schon vorher regelmäßig in der virtuellen Welt “gelebt”? Ich persönlich spiele überhaupt kein Second Life mehr. Den Reiz hat diese “Spiel” schon längst für mich verloren und dieser Ansich bin ich scheinbar nicht alleine, wie dieser Artikelim Standard bekräftigt.</description>

      <description>Wie so viele Medien, die heutzutage up-to-date sein wollen beschäftigt sich auch die WELT ONLINEmit dem Thema Second Life. Auf der einen Seite gibt es Menschen, die sich das Second Life als neue Welt erschließen, vom großen Geld träumen und in der virtuellen Welt mit anderen “Avataren” ihren Feierabend verbringen.
Andere sehen das Second Life als ein Phänomen, das die Vereinsamung der Menschen vorantreibt, und durchaus Suchtpotenzial hat. Die Welt Online legt in diesem Artikeleine sehr interessante dritte Betrachtungsweise dar, die durchaus realitätsnah ist.</description>

      <description>Die neue Informationsgesellschaft, wie sie sich in Zeiten von Web2.0zeigt, ist eines der spannenden Themen mit dem man sich zur Zeit auseinandersetzen kann.

Nicht nur, dass Netzwerke, wie sie sich im StudiVZbzw.</description>

      <description>Second Lifewer kenn das nicht, oder besser gefragt, wer hat nicht schon davon gehört? Interessanterweise haben bei der letzten Vorlesung in einem Hörsaal von ca. 300 – 400 Studierenden nur 3 – 4 Studierende angegeben, Second Life zu spielen. Spielen? Second Life spielt man nicht, man lebt in der virtuellen Welt und versucht sich dort in irgendeiner Weise zu verwirklichen. Ob das gelingt ist verschieden. Interessant ist auch, dass die Studierenden von denen hier dei Rede ist nicht einem Studium nachgehen, welches überhaupt nichts mit Informationstechnologie zu tun hat.</description>
