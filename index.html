        Have you ever wondered on how the concept of Microservices developed? The following video by Adrian Cockcroft gives a quite good overview on the evolution of microservices.

        For those who want to understand &#8220;Serverless architectures&#8221;, I recommend reading this post by Mike Roberts. The term Serverless was already used in 2012. Mike defines the following characteristics of serverless architectures:
Mike Roberts&#8217; Definition of Serverless No management of server hosts or server processes You as a developer don&#8217;t have to care about e.g. the number of servers running your software or where where it runs or things like OS upgrades, etc.

        I found an intersting article on the rising stars in the JavaScript world in 2017. There are the most important sections taken from the report. Most Popular Projects Overall  Vue.js strikes again   Once again, Vue.js is the trendiest project of the year, with more than 40,000 stars added on GitHub during the year.  Front-end Frameworks  The Big-3: Vue, React and Angular   Without surprise, the 3 most popular UI frameworks are Vue.

        Currently I work on an implementation for authentication and authorization using Spring Boot, Spring Security, OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). In order to get a good understanding on these topics I found several talks that I&#8217;m going to list here.
&#8220;100% Stateless with JWT (JSON Web Token)&#8221; by Hubert Sablonnière. I found it very useful to get a better understanding on using JWTs to create a really stateless authentication architecture.

Great talk about stream processing! https://t.co/Yn9eHLNZag #kafka #kafkastreams  &mdash; Manuel Stößel (@Manuel_Stoessel) October 15, 2016  There is also a good article on Apache Kafka Streams with lots of background information.

        ImageMagick is a powerfull tool to manipulate images. If you want to convert a .PDF to an .PNG file use the following command:
convert -verbose -density 300 -trim input.pdf -quality 100 -sharpen 0x1.0 -background white -flatten output.png
Assuming that your pdf is called &#8220;input.pdf&#8221; and consists only of one page. The above command colors any transparent background white.

        In order to prepare and pass the Salesforce App Builder Exam I follow the learning path as described in the official &#8220;Certified Salesforce Platform App Builder Study Guide&#8220;.
But how many questions on each topic have to be answered in the exam? The total number of questions is 60 and the expected number of questions on each topic can easily be calculated:
Overview of exam questions per topic  Topic  Weight  Questions     Business Logic and Process Automation   27%   16,2     Data Modeling and Management   20%   12     User Interface   14%   8,4     Security   10%   6     Salesforce Fundamentals   8%   4,8     App Deployment   8%   4,8     Reporting   5%   3     Mobile   5%   3     Social   3%   1,8     Total   100%   60    My strategy is to begin with the most important topic with the most questions and work my way down to the end of the list.

        As a developer, there comes the time were you think about how to version your software. One approach is &#8220;Semantic Versioning&#8221; which leverages the level of change on your public API. Depending on what you changed in your code, Semantic Versioning proposes different version numbers:
 Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
 MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

What are the eight elementary skills every entrepreneur needs? Thomas H. Byers et. al. compiled the following list in his book on &#8220;Technology Ventures &#8211; From Idea to Enterprise&#8221;:
 Entrepreneurs initiate and operate a purposeful enterprise. Entrepreneurs operate within the context and industrial environment at the time of initiation.

        [][1]Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection The Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection was published as part of the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP). It consists of an interesting collection of large networks. The aim of SNAP is provide a general purpose network analysis and graph mining library.
The SNAP Collection contains datasets from various domains such as:
 Social networks : online social networks, edges represent interactions between people Networks with ground-truth communities : ground-truth network communities in social and information networks Communication networks : email communication networks with edges representing communication Citation networks : nodes represent papers, edges represent citations Collaboration networks : nodes represent scientists, edges represent collaborations (co-authoring a paper) Web graphs : nodes represent webpages and edges are hyperlinks Amazon networks : nodes represent products and edges link commonly co-purchased products Internet networks : nodes represent computers and edges communication Road networks : nodes represent intersections and edges roads connecting the intersections Autonomous systems : graphs of the internet Signed networks : networks with positive and negative edges (friend/foe, trust/distrust) Location-based online social networks : Social networks with geographic check-ins Wikipedia networks and metadata : Talk, editing and voting data from Wikipedia Twitter and Memetracker : Memetracker phrases, links and 467 million Tweets Online communities : Data from online communities such as Reddit and Flickr Online reviews : Data from online review systems such as BeerAdvocate and Amazon Information cascades : &#8230;  It is definitely worth of having a look at the different datasets.

        I got Skype running on Ubuntu 13.10 using the following commands:
[code lang=&#8221;bash&#8221;]
sudo -s
mv /usr/bin/skype /usr/bin/skype-bin
emacs /usr/bin/skype
[/code]
Filling the file with the following content:
[code lang=&#8221;bash&#8221;]
#!/bin/sh
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1
exec skype-bin
[/code]
Don&#8217;t forget to change the file mode:
[code lang=&#8221;bash&#8221;]
chmod 0755 /usr/bin/skype

        First you have to install ncpfs using apt-get:
[code language=&#8221;bash&#8221;]
sudo apt-get install ncpfs
[/code]
Then mount your novell directories using the following commands:
[code language=&#8221;bash&#8221;]
mkdir /media/novell
sudo chown : /media/novell
sudo ncpmount -S  -A  -U  -u  -g  -o nfsextras,symlinks,tcp,rw /media/novell -p cp850 -y utf8
[/code]
This will mount all of the volumes. If you wish to mount a specific volume use the -V option.

        Working remote becomes more and more important to many people. Remote: Office Not Required written by Jason Fried (co-founder of 37signals) and David Heinemeier Hansson (original creator of Ruby on Rails) is a great book dealing with this topic. It describes in detail the benefits and problems of building a software company having employees working from remote locations spread all over the world. This gives them great flexibility and enables to recruit talents without being tied to a specific location.

        Howto fix startup error of Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle) on CentOS 6? You just need to modify the spoon.sh startup script after downloading and unzipping Pentaho Data Integration. The modification updates the Java runtime options for Kettle to startup properly. Therefore open
[code language=&#8221;bash&#8221;]spoon.sh[/code]
and change the end of the file in the following way:
[code language=&#8221;bash&#8221;]
# **********************
# ** Set java runtime options **
# ** Change 512m to higher values in case you run out of memory **

        Dilbert&#8217;s Salary Theorem states that: &#8220;Engineers and scientists will never make as much money as business executives.&#8220;
Now we have an mathematical proof that explains why this is true:
 Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power Postulate 2: Time is Money  As every engineer knows,
 Power = Work/Time
 Since Knowledge = Power we have:
 Knowledge = Work/Time.
 Since Time = Money we have:
 Knowledge = Work/Money.

 A NOSQL Summer is a network of local reading groups, that will decipher &amp; discuss NOSQL-related articles, from late June to early September 2010. Each group sets its own meeting pace (usually once a week or once every two weeks) and select which papers are up for discussion.
At every cycle, members read the selected paper at home and then meet up for an hour or so to discuss, debate and answer their own questions.

        Grabeeter (@grabeeter) has just been launched and I think it is a very useful tool.
Grabeeter enables you to grab your tweets which means that you are able to store your tweets on your local harddrive in a structured format (xml at the time). Using the Grabeeter Client you are also able to perform searches on your local stored tweets.
This solves in parts the following problem. Maybe some of you have already noticed that if you have written more than 3200 Tweets you are not able to access your first tweets anymore due to Twitter access restrictions.

        In public key infrastructures a common problem is that both communication partners have to have the same key in order communicate in a secure way (to encrypt and decrypt messages properly). The question is how is it practically possible to share a secret key over an untrusted channel like the internet for example. The solution is the use of asynchronous methods (public and private keys) in order to exchange the secret key in a secure way.

Quite impressing how social media has developed over the last year. Facebook for example has gained 200 million users in just one year. That&#8217;s incredible &#8230;

Dieser Artikel beschäftigt sich mit der Frage, ob Lern-Management-Systeme (LMS) zu Wissensmanagement Werkzeugen gezählt werden sollten. Die Autoren definieren zunächst Wissensmanagement und Lernen auf Grundlage vorhandener Literatur, bevor auf eLearning und dort im speziellen auf LMS eingegangen wird.

        Image via Wikipedia  Mashable has just published a post titled &#8220;Nobody Can Stop Facebook Because Nobody Understands Facebook&#8220;. There is an interesting sentence in this post:
 Have the nuances of online privacy become so complex that they’re beyond the comprehension of mere mortals? I’m not saying that Facebook has any intent to cause confusion, but the complexities of the open vs closed debate and the prescriptive vs descriptive nature of the “everybody” setting effectively act to shut down public discourse.

        The Virtual Revolution refers to the fact that 20-25% of the word&#8217;s population is using the web by now, while other 80% are yet either not connected to broadband connections or are just not using it, as Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, states. In Afrika for example, people are now getting connected to broadband internet in a wide variety of areas. This means that the digital revolution that has shaped our world as we know it now, will happen in these areas too.

A very interesting approach which leads to the question if people want if all of their data is available publicly?

You are able to look at hundred thousands of information space entities such as pictures, &#8230; and filter these in different ways (zoom in/out, create links between different information items, &#8230;). The following video describes Pivot in more detail:

        David Leggett tried to answer this question in a blogpost written for uxBOOTH. He writes:
 The future of how we interact with computers is exciting to say the least. What once seemed like nonsense outside of Hollywood and Science Fiction is now starting to find it’s way into reality, and some of the technology is a bit overwhelming. Have a taste of what the future of interface design has to offer:

        Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google was answering this question in an interesting interview at Gartner Symposium/ITxpo Orlando 2009. ReadWriteWeb has summarized the highlights of Eric&#8217;s interview as follows:
  Five years from now the internet will be dominated by Chinese-language content. Today&#8217;s teenagers are the model of how the web will work in five years &#8211; they jump from app to app to app seamlessly. Five years is a factor of ten in Moore&#8217;s Law, meaning that computers will be capable of far more by that time than they are today.

The interesting and innovative part of this e-mail system is the use of semantic technologies in order to determine the recipient of an e-mail message. Users don&#8217;t have to bother on keeping track of e-mail addresses, they just type in the real name of the recipient letting the system searching the right recipient address.

             SuggestRSS is a service suggesting feeds based on your actual feeds. Just upload a OPML export of your current subscribed feeds and you are going to get nice new suggestions. I tried it out and think it is very useful.

        Sergej Maslow and Sidney Redner, both researchers have found out that Google&#8216;s Page Rank algorithm could be used to predict future nobel price winners based on interlinked scientific papers. Scientific papers are interlinked by references, just like websites are which means they can be ranked by googles page rank algorithm. Taking into account how important a paper is, it is possible to generate a list of wighted ranked scientific papers.

Auszug aus dem Abstract:
 Dieser Artikel beschäftigt sich mit Anwendungen, die das Linking Open Data Konzept verwenden. Zuerst wird auf das Open Data Movement eingegangen und anschließend auf das W3C SWEO Linking Open Data Community Project. Es sind zahlreiche Anwendungen entstanden, die Linked Open Data verwenden und daraus einen Mehrwert für Benutzer erzielen.

        One of the highlights of October&#8217;s Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco was the emergence of &#8216;Semantic Apps&#8217; as a force. Note that we&#8217;re not necessarily talking about the Semantic Web, which is the Tim Berners-Lee W3C led initiative that touts technologies like RDF, OWL and other standards for metadata. Semantic Apps may use those technologies, but not necessarily [ReadWriteWeb 2007].  ReadWriteWeb has published a great list of 10 interesting semantic apps at the end of 2007.

        SMOB is a prototype developed to enable semantic microblogging. It can be seen as Twitter enriched with semantic data.
[slideshare id=472659&amp;doc=sfsw-1213739228503754-8&amp;w=425]
John Breslin writes in his blog post:
 The prototype uses FOAF and SIOC to model microbloggers, their properties, account and service information, and the microblog updates that users create. A multitude of publishing services can ping one or a set of aggregating servers as selected by each user, and it is important to note that users retain control of their own data through self hosting.

        It stands to reason that people who are &#8220;starting to come down with something&#8221; often take the opportunity to search for information on what ails them, even before they discuss their symptoms with a healthcare professional. Who gets more of those searches than anyone? Google, of course. [ReadWriteWeb]
 Google offers a new service called Google Flu Trends. The service uses an analysis of Google&#8217;s millions of search queries every day to calculate flu trends.

        Need a Problem? Three guys from Switzerland have found a new business model: They create problems for their customers. You might know the film called &#8220;The Game&#8221; where Michael Douglas as a bored but rich investment banker gets involved in a kind of game.
The three guys from Switzerland make a lot of money with their project called &#8220;need a problem&#8221; now. On the website www.needaproblem.com you can pay and they are going to give you a problem to solve.

        CNN yesterday used holograms for interviews in their broadcast on the presedential election 2008. The journalist Jessica Yellin was beamed from Chicago to the CNN studio, New York where Wolf Blitzer was speaking with her virtual hologram. Very interesting technique which shows where new media is moving.

Hier kann man sich die Vorlage für das Spiel herunterladen. Danach einfach ausdrucken und los geht’s. Spielgeld sucht man einfach auf Flickr. Oder man lädt es direkt hier herunter.

        Ich habe gerade diesen Artikel zu Second Life gefunden. Demnach soll Second Life ein Filtersystem bekommen mittels dessen jede Regierung selbst entscheiden kann, welchen Gesetzen ihre Bürger in Second Life unterliegen. Hier geht’s zum gesamten Artikel.

        Die Kombination von Last.fm und YouTube nennt sich Last.tv. Last.tv ist ein peronalisierter Musik Channel, der über das Benutzerprofil (Benutzernamen) von last.fm eine Musik Playlist erstellt und auf YouTube nach passenden Videos sucht und diese abspielt! Sehr interessantes Musik-Video Meshup. Last.fm und YouTube ist eine sehr interessante Kombination!
Auf jeden Fall einen Klick wert!

        Wer schon immer mal von YouTube Videos bzw. von last.fm Playlists geweckt werden wollte, der sollte sich unbedingt ALARMD anschaun! Hier kann man sich seinen Wecker online stellen. Dieser holt sich dann von YouTube bzw. über last.fm und andere Services seine Videos und Musikstreams und spielt diese zur gewünschten Zeit ab! Ich finde die Idee einfach toll und bin komplett begeistert! Sehr coole Sache!

        Wer hat nicht schon verschiedenste IM Messenger auf seinem Computer installiert? Bei jedem Verbindungsaufbau zum Internet versuchen diese auch einen Teil des Internets für sich zu beanspruchen. Wem das zu stressig ist, bzw. wer möchte, dass all diese IM Dienste irgendwo zentral verwaltet werden können, der sollte sich einmal meebo genauer anschauen. Bei meebo ist es möglich jegliche IM Dienste über eine Website zu verwalten und über diese mittels seiner IM Accounts zu kommunizieren.

        Hallo alle miteinander!
Ist Second Life ein Hype oder nicht!? Mich würde einmal interessieren, wer von Euch überhaupt Second Life spielt! Spielt ihr Second Life nur wegen GADI oder habt ihr auch schon vorher regelmäßig in der virtuellen Welt “gelebt”? Ich persönlich spiele überhaupt kein Second Life mehr. Den Reiz hat diese “Spiel” schon längst für mich verloren und dieser Ansich bin ich scheinbar nicht alleine, wie dieser Artikel im Standard bekräftigt.

        Für jeden der schon immer mal das Video zu einem Audiotrack sehen wollte sollte sich einmal www.musicmesh.net ansehen. Dort kann man nach beliebigen Musikern suchen und sich danach ihre Songs anhören. Das coole dabei, es wird automatisch ein Musikvideo auf youtube gesucht und abgespielt! Sehr coole Sache!
Metadaten über Musiker, Tracks, Alben, etc… werden per Audioscrobbler Web Services API von www.last.fm bezogen, passende Videos werden wie gesagt über die API von YouTube gesucht und eingebunden!

        Sloog ist ein Bookmarking Service der Spanischen Agentur Mosi-Mosi für Second Life Bürger. Man kann beliebige Orte und Avatare speichern um sie später wiederzufinden. Dies funktioniert nicht nur im Spiel (via plugin) sondern auch im Webbrowser via www.sloog.org.Sicher ein nützliches Tool, das so manchem beim Wiederfinden von Orten und Bekanntschaften nützlich sein kann.

        Laut diesem Artikel von “WELT ONLINE” machen sich Glücksspieler, die in Second Life spielen möglicherweise strafbar. Das FBI prüft eine Anlage wegen illegalem Glückspiels gegen die Firma Linden Labs. Linden-Lab-Manager Ginsu Yoon antwortete darauf mit einer Einladung an die FBI ermittler. Diese wären eingeladen sich in den virtuellen Casinos umzusehen und zu prüfen, ob diese gegen US-Gesetze verstoßen. Den gesamten Artikel kann man hier nachlesen.

        In unserer heutigen von Informationen überfluteten Informationsgesellschaft wird ein Aspekt immmer wichtiger. Dies ist das altbewährte seit Jahrhunderten praktizierte und immer wieder so hilfreiche “FRAGEN”. Auch das Web2.0 bzw. die gesamte Internet Community hat sich dies zu nutze gemacht und Aplikationen wie askeet! oder Yahoo! Answers bzw. Google Answers entwickelt. Ein interessantes Werbevideo von ask.com kann hier bewundert werden.

        Wie so viele Medien, die heutzutage up-to-date sein wollen beschäftigt sich auch die WELT ONLINE mit dem Thema Second Life. Auf der einen Seite gibt es Menschen, die sich das Second Life als neue Welt erschließen, vom großen Geld träumen und in der virtuellen Welt mit anderen “Avataren” ihren Feierabend verbringen.
Andere sehen das Second Life als ein Phänomen, das die Vereinsamung der Menschen vorantreibt, und durchaus Suchtpotenzial hat. Die Welt Online legt in diesem Artikel eine sehr interessante dritte Betrachtungsweise dar, die durchaus realitätsnah ist.

        Die neue Informationsgesellschaft, wie sie sich in Zeiten von Web2.0 zeigt, ist eines der spannenden Themen mit dem man sich zur Zeit auseinandersetzen kann.
Wo YouTube, Flickr, last.fm, Wikipedia, StudiVZ, SchuelerVZ, Facebook, … Benutzern die Möglichkeit selbst aktiv das neue Web in einer noch nie dagewesenen Weise zu gestalten, lässt sich erkennen wie groß der Bedarf ist, sich mit anderen Benutzern zu vernetzen. Nicht nur, dass Netzwerke, wie sie sich im StudiVZ bzw.

        Second Life wer kenn das nicht, oder besser gefragt, wer hat nicht schon davon gehört? Interessanterweise haben bei der letzten Vorlesung in einem Hörsaal von ca. 300 &#8211; 400 Studierenden nur 3 &#8211; 4 Studierende angegeben, Second Life zu spielen. Spielen? Second Life spielt man nicht, man lebt in der virtuellen Welt und versucht sich dort in irgendeiner Weise zu verwirklichen. Ob das gelingt ist verschieden. Interessant ist auch, dass die Studierenden von denen hier dei Rede ist nicht einem Studium nachgehen, welches überhaupt nichts mit Informationstechnologie zu tun hat.
